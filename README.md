# Finite state machine

Project made during laboratory classes of "Podstawy Informatyki" in first term. My goal was to write a program which would emulate Finite state machine behaviour based on given grammar. There is a report written in Polish in folder "Sprawozdanie". Repository is an upload of a written project. Program made in Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise.
